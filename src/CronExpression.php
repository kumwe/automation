 * before it reaches the database, and builds it again at dispatch to advance `next_run_at`. Each
 * field accepts `*`, a single value, a range, a comma-separated list, and a `/step` suffix, and a
 * day-of-week seven is folded onto zero so both spellings of Sunday work. The two calendar fields
 * follow the traditional cron rule: when day-of-month and day-of-week are both restricted, either
 * one matching is enough, and when either is a bare `*` both have to match.
