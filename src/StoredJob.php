/**
 * One reserved queue row, carrying the fencing token that proves the reservation is still this worker's.
 *
 * `JobQueue::claim()` builds this from the row it reserved and the worker hands the same instance back
 * to `renew()`, `complete()` and `fail()`. Each of those writes matches on the lease token as well as
 * the identifier, so a worker whose lease expired and whose job a sibling has re-claimed can no longer
 * move the row — which is what makes an expired lease safe to reap. Construction rejects a token that
 * is not a canonical UUID and an execution class that is not a known one, so a row with a missing or
 * hand-edited lease or scope column never reaches a handler.
