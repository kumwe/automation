/**
 * Decides whether a failed job attempt is worth repeating, and how long to wait before repeating it.
 *
 * The policy keeps apart two questions a caller would otherwise blur: whether the fault can clear at all,
 * and how hard to back off if it can. The first is answered from the shape of the thrown value, so a
 * handler signals intent by what it throws rather than by a status it returns. The second is full jitter
 * — a delay drawn uniformly between zero and a cap that doubles each attempt — which scatters a fleet of
 * workers retrying the same outage instead of letting them collide on one schedule. Both the randomness
 * and the clock arrive through the constructor, so the same failure yields the same decision in a test.
