 * Supplier of the random number a retry delay is drawn from.

 * value inside it, instead of calling `random_int()` itself. That indirection is what makes the policy
 * testable: a test substitutes a source that always answers the same number and can then assert the
 * exact delay and the exact instant a retry falls due. The policy does not trust the answer — it
 * re-checks the returned value against the range it asked for and refuses one that falls outside — so
 * an implementation cannot lengthen or cancel a backoff by answering out of bounds.
