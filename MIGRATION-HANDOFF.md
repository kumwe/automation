# automation implementation handoff

## Migration/implementation summary

Repair the installed example bootstrap so a host-provided Composer autoloader works without a nested package vendor directory. The proposed 0.2.2 successor preserves the runtime API and exact dependency pins from published 0.2.1. The changelog version describes the proposed artifact; it is not a publication observation.

## Public API and responsibility

Cron, retry, handler dispatch and job declarations are implemented and tested here. The App retains durable queues, scheduler claims, transactions, tenant authority, extension admission and worker orchestration. Every exported member is recorded in resources/public-api/v1.json and documented in docs/public-api.md. The current surface contains 28 types. 24 types have recorded extraction provenance; package-native composition is identified separately.

## Capability reuse/semantic input review

The implementation consumes the exact canonical dependency contracts recorded in composer.json. Install the exact independently verified successor; run Composer resolution, archive consumer gates and affected App integration tests before namespace removal.

## Consumer inventory

The machine record lists actual source mappings, known consumer paths and concrete namespace replacements. resources/migration/consumer-inventory.json and resources/migration/source-map.json retain source digests where present. Dynamic references and same-namespace names must be searched again during adoption; the inventory does not imply that App has already switched ownership.

## Test ownership

The package archive gate executes the original installed example in fresh PHP processes with explicit and preloaded host autoloaders. It also checks missing explicit paths both before and after preload. These bootstrap regressions belong to the package distribution gate.

Package tests own portable values, validation, service behavior, explicit construction and malformed-input regressions. The machine record identifies the source suites to split. Host persistence, transactions, authority, transport and operational integration stay in App. After verified adoption, remove duplicate library implementation assertions from App together with their legacy source.

## Next-task execution notes

The selected runtime dependencies are kumwe/canonical-json 0.1.1, kumwe/contribution 0.1.1, kumwe/access-context 0.1.2.
Access Context 0.1.2 was observed at source 132c3cd7c229ceda4398e19140d1477512c27ebf.
Run the package dependency-readiness gate before selecting the coordinated consumer graph.
Independent release attestations remain external and are not inferred from these version pins.

Independent successor release verification and the final package gate remain necessary before App adoption. Install the exact independently verified successor; run Composer resolution, archive consumer gates and affected App integration tests before namespace removal. Run final source and clean archive gates before admitting the package; then update the App dependency lock, replace namespaces, retain host adapters and remove only the inventoried portable legacy implementations.

## Drift check

Reconcile the recorded source commit and per-file source digests with the current App before adoption. Recompute all public manifest hashes together. Keep actual release observations and final tested commit identities outside the tested source tree to avoid self-referential evidence.

## Validation recipe and observed local results

Run composer check with the documented PHP runtime and extensions. The review added and exercised the boundary regressions described in CHANGELOG.md. A final gate pass, remote CI status and immutable release verification are distinct observations; neither a proposed version nor this handoff attests publication. See docs/integration.md and the package check scripts for the exact archive and runtime recipe.
